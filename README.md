# CA02_Spam_Detection
The purpose of this program is for training a ML model with a set of emails labelled as spam or not spam to classify future emails accordingly.

### The data I am using has been provided by an LMU professor in an Intro to ML MSBA course. Within this repository, I have included a  file included called "CA02_NB_Assignment" that I referenced to complete the CA02 assignment.

## Prior to running the code please ensure the following:
* Dowload the zip file "Data.zip" that includes folders called "test-mails" and "train-mails" (test emails and training emails).
* Make sure that you are using the relative path names of the data folder locations based on which folder they are located on on your computer (ex: "./train-mails").
